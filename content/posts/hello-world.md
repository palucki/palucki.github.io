Hello World! Or maybe rather:

{{< highlight cpp  >}}
std::cout << "Hello World\n"
{{< / highlight >}}

Welcome to my personal blog!

### Why I decided to start a blog?

I always wanted to share my projects, knowledge, tips&tricks etc. with others.
Also, I wanted to have my personal space, which serves the purpose of my CV.
Is there a better way to do this than starting a blog?

### Why Hugo?

I wanted to have my content organized, portable...
Static site generator sounds like a silver bullet for my needs.
Among multiple choices, Hugo is recommended to be fast, user friendly yet powerful.

### About structure

Intially I planned to have blog + personal wiki in one site. However when exploring available Hugo themes

Then I decided to use great [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a local wiki backed up by github repo based synchronization.

### What's next?

I am going to iteratively add new features and content to this blog. Some improvements include:
- comments system
- completed projects 
-
