#### Hello World! 

Or maybe rather:

{{< highlight cpp  >}}
std::cout << "Hello World\n"
{{< / highlight >}}

Welcome to my personal blog!

### Why I decided to start a blog?

Creating my own space on the web have always been my dream.
I always wanted to share my projects, knowledge, tips&tricks or unusual experiences with others.
Also, I wanted to have my kind-of portfolio online, which serves the purpose of my CV.
Is there a better way to do this than starting a blog?

### Why Hugo?

I wanted to have my content organized, portable, easily accesible and editable.
I am not a web developer, so the less frontend work the better.
Static site generator sounds like a silver bullet for my needs.
Among multiple choices, Hugo is recommended to be fast, secure, user friendly and powerful.

### About structure

Intially I planned to have blog and a personal wiki in one site. 
However when exploring available Hugo themes it turned out, that there is no nice-looking theme capable of serving both.

Then I decided to use great [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a local wiki backed up by github repo based synchronization and separate it from the main blog page.

### What's next?

I am going to iteratively add new features and content to this blog. Some improvements include:
- comments system
- completed projects 
- search functionality
- content, content and even more content

Keep yours fingers crossed and stay tuned!
